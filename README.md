# Taksha Engineering — Next.js + Tailwind Prototype

This repository contains a small Next.js static prototype for Taksha Engineering's homepage (services, projects, process, contact).

Quick start (macOS / zsh):

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/srihari/projects/Taksha
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open in your browser:

http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- This scaffold uses Tailwind CSS. You can customize `tailwind.config.js` to tune colors, fonts and content paths.
- Placeholder SVG images are in `public/images/`. Replace them with production photos (prefer WebP or optimized JPG).
- To deploy, push to a Git host and use Vercel (recommended) or any static Node host.
 
Production build

```bash
# install deps (if needed)
npm install
# build for production
npm run build
# start the production server
npm start
```
